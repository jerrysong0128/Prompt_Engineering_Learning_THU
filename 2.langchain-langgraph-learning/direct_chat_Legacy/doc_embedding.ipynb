Goal and scope\\n\\nIn this study, the goal is investigating environmental impacts based on data generated by a production unit of cement, limiting it to extraction of required raw materials and fuels, transportation of these inputs, electricity usage and emissions from the industrial process. Consumption and ﬁnal disposition of cement as waste were not taken into account due to methodological aspects and lack of a deﬁned horizon for useful life and alternatives of ﬁnal disposal in Brazil. Thus, the extraction/production of supplies and the emissions associated to Portland cement production are within the boundaries of the studied system, as shown in Fig. 1. In this case, foreground systems correspond to processes whose actions can be directly measured (primary or secondary data); background sys- tems are related to processes whose actions cannot be directly taken. In the latter systems, external secondary data are used instead.

The main outputs are direct emissions and secondary pollutants from clinker production and waste disposal processes.

Moreover, we focused on comparing the environmental impacts induced by different waste disposal methods. In this context, the waste transportation process was not considered.

System B.1 represents a scenario in which only coal is used as the source of fuel energy. In scenario T.1, the fuel source of hazardous waste is added to replace approximately 60% of the coal. Replacement of 60% of the coal was modeled because the data associated with the cement facility used in this study typically targets 50 to 70% fossil fuel replacement on an annual basis. In Scenario T.2, the sole source of fuel for the production system is hazardous waste.

The entire life cycle, from cradle to grave, using industrial solid wastes or conventional raw materials will be compared. 2.2 Scope definition\\n\\n2.2.1 System boundaries and functional unit The main problem for the use of a red mud slurry, aluminum slag, desulfurization (FGD) gypsum and carbide slag as raw materials in the cement industry is their high-water content (30%– 60%) (Tsakiridis et al,2004).Therefore, the wet raw material preparation technique, which includes crushing, wet-milling, wet-homogenizing, and filter pressing, has been used and has proven to be successful in our previous practices. For the conventional scenario, the raw material preparation process consists of raw material crushing and milling. To compare our technique and the conventional technique, boundaries of traditional clinker production were expanded as shown in Fig. 1(a). This boundary definition includes raw material mining, transportation, raw material preparation, coal grinding, and clinker calcination in the rotary kiln, but excludes cement grinding, packaging, cement transportation, and usage of cement products. The research object is only from the sources of raw materials to the formation of SAC clinker, as this selection has already revealed differences between our technique and the conventional technique. Fig 1(b) shows the system of SAC clinker preparation by using 100% industrial solid wastes; this boundary definition includes transportation, raw material preparation, coal grinding, and clinker calcination in the rotary kiln for the industrial solid waste scenario. It is assumed that there are no environmental effects from the production of industrial wastes if at some point the industrial wastes are considered as by-products or co-products, then the hypothesis above is invalid.', 'source': '[Comparative life cycle assessment of sulfoaluminate clinker production derived from industrial solid wastes and conventional raw materials.
